The story I created was about an agent carrying out a mission. The agent had a base and received various assignments. I learned to use features that allow navigation back and forth between scenes. In each scene, certain elements were to be visible, and when moving to the next mission scene, different functions would be activated. If returning to a previous scene, either something new would play or the last action would continue.\n\nThrough this project, I learned how a save system works. I understood how to manage state and data between different scenes and how to implement functions to resume game progression. I also created the scenes in this story myself by modeling them in Blender. All this was completed over a period of one month. I successfully achieved the task's goal and further developed my skills in game development."

        "projectPurpose": "Building on the foundational knowledge from my first API project, the .NET Course Application API represents a significant advancement in my API development skills. This project showcases more advanced practices and a fully realized web application. In this project, I designed a robust API using best practices in .NET, implementing five controllers to manage complex data relationships and their interactions. The architecture follows a clean separation of concerns, utilizing a three-layer structure: Repository, Service, and Controller. This structure ensures a well-organized codebase and efficient data management. I utilized SQL for database management, with the SQL server hosted remotely on the Loopia cloud platform, providing a scalable and secure environment for data handling. To optimize the application's performance, I implemented asynchronous programming with async/await tasks, ensuring that operations such as database queries and external API calls are executed efficiently. Continuing with Cloudinary for managing images and files, I addressed its 100MB file size limitation by implementing a custom file repository. This enhancement supports the upload of larger media files, including WebGL web-based games. Users can upload a ZIP file containing the game, which is then processed and converted into a playable WebGL game using Unity, directly accessible on the website. In terms of authentication, I explored advanced .NET security practices by developing a robust registration and login system with email verification. This system was integrated with SMTP services provided by Loopia, ensuring reliable email delivery for account verification. Upon registration, users receive a confirmation email with a verification link, ensuring a secure and reliable authentication process. Comprehensive error handling was another critical aspect of this API. I ensured that errors are effectively communicated to the front end, allowing the Angular front end to display detailed error messages provided by the API. This feature enhances the user experience and simplifies troubleshooting. Overall, the .NET Course Application API demonstrates my ability to apply best practices, manage complex data relationships, integrate various functionalities into a cohesive web application, and effectively utilize asynchronous programming for enhanced performance. This project marks a significant milestone in my API development journey."

I leveraged TypeScript's powerful features, such as interfaces and type safety, to avoid the use of any and ensure a more reliable and maintainable codebase. Working with TypeScript was particularly gratifying, as it resonated with my experience in C#, a language I greatly enjoy. Throughout the project, I utilized RxJS and Angular services to align with Angular‚Äôs best practices, incorporating reactive programming for efficient handling of asynchronous operations. I also implemented thorough validation to ensure the application's robustness. To enhance the user interface and experience, I integrated Bootstrap for responsive design and Video.js for media playback. Additionally, I employed Angular guards to secure routes and control access within the application, adding an extra layer of security and user management. The application was designed with a focus on dynamism and extensibility, making it easy to add new features in the future. After completing the development, it was published. Overall, the Angular Course Application was a significant step in expanding my front-end development skills, providing valuable hands-on experience with Angular and TypeScript."

This project was motivated by a desire to learn and apply core concepts in a practical development environment. The primary goal of this API was to manage relationships between artists and songs, effectively handling relational data. To ensure that the controllers remain clean and focused on handling requests, I developed a service layer that encapsulates business logic. This approach allowed me to structure the application for better organization and scalability. I used SQL as the database solution, which provided me with hands-on experience in managing and querying relational data effectively. Additionally, I implemented asynchronous programming using async/await tasks to improve the responsiveness and performance of the application, particularly when handling database operations and external API calls. A key learning outcome was the implementation of pagination and filtering features. I added custom query parameters such as Search Term, Genre, Page Number, Page Size, and Alphabetical Ordering, enabling efficient data retrieval and navigation. This provided valuable experience in managing data access and enhancing user interaction. For managing media files, I integrated Cloudinary to store images and songs. This integration was a critical learning experience in working with cloud services and efficiently managing media files. Additionally, I implemented basic .NET authentication, allowing user registration and login. While this provided a foundational understanding of authentication, I recognize areas for improvement and plan to enhance these features in the future. Overall, this project was an essential step in my learning journey, offering practical experience in API development."
